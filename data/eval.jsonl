The one that I engaged in the most, in terms of my finances was doing interviews, which was really good because, I feel like I haven't been getting as much interviews for the amount of jobs I've been applying to. But because I got those interviews, I kinda fixed my mind on only, doing those interviews. And also for, like, everything that happened to me throughout the week, I just felt like I was overwhelmed so much that I started to avoid doing basically anything else that was of, anything else for the looking for the job, which I'm kind of, like, I'm kind of in that regretful state, unfortunately, like, to admit. So because I had all the, the interviews and the work that I was doing for my part time job, I made it as an excuse to say I'm not available to do, any of this, work, which is really, really bad. Now seeing, like, being on the weekend, just understanding that, one of the interviews, it didn't fall through because, or it fell through because, I did not or it's not I can't really meet the travel requirements at the time. And the second one, the interview process is pretty long. So, I'm kind of in that state where, if I start tomorrow, for on Monday, just starting with, like, applying for jobs and then going into the office, asking or going into, like, MIT offices or the department heads and just explaining, hey. I'm looking for a job. Is there a way that you can help? I think that would be really helpful because it won't, let me stress in finding the right job, or won't let me it won't let me stress looking at LinkedIn and seeing that my job application got, like, a look, but then it's a denial, or it just sits there for however long, and then I never get a response.
