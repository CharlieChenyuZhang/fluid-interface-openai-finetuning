And that's really the only thing that I got done that day because, like, after that point and I kinda just went to sleep. Or and, like, other like, for another example, like, like, I would just do, like, an essay for the entire day. And because I did that essay the entire day, then I wouldn't be able to focus on anything else. But then after I'm done with the essay, the very next day is kinda like a leisure day because it's it was a hard hard day at work, or it's just the day that I wake up very late and then wake up early and then, I'm not able to go really go to class or yeah.

I called my parents and my parents were really, they really wanted, they were like, they sent me a few things in order to prepare me for the interviews that I received. So I had an inter I I'm going to receive an interview with two companies, which is really amazing because both of them, they offer a lot of, financial support that I would need. And also, they're related to the major that I'm doing right now. So that's really good. I guess, in that regard, being able to, like, have some parents or parents that have gone through what I'm going through and understand the system of it's not like how how much you know it, but it's who you know. I think that's really helpful because, being able to have that support and also friends that, have gone through the same thing, it really gives me the avenue or the the foresight not foresight, what am I trying to say?

So that kind of mindset, I want to, start to change, like, now, like, rapidly. I guess, like, interpreting, I guess, like, the way that to that I interpret the sorry. I'm just trying to gather my thoughts. Yeah. I guess, like, the way that I interpret the being in this financial, financial situation is that either I can stay complacent, receive a part time job. Like, I do have a part time job and be able to commit myself to that to that part time and then be able to, gain the income that I'm looking for, which, yeah, I can do that, but it's not the most effective for sure. Like, in the slightest, it's it's not. But or I can just or I can commit a month to, maybe not committing to that job because the part time is very flexible. Like, I'm able to work maybe thirty hours a week or ten hours depending on how much time I put to it. So the other option is to commit a lot of time to finding a job, utilize, like, utilizing MIT's resources, going to the career fair, and then be able to try to, like, find a job that will hire me in the next, month. Because, like, if I receive the particular job that I'm looking for, that is very beneficial for my career development and also, allows me to cover finances, then I'll be set in a very good situation. So I guess, like, I like, interpreting that, like, of course, I'm gonna lose, like or it's gonna be a very rough month. Like, I'm gonna have to, spend a lot less, be able to make sure to budget out every single thing that I do for the month, but, it will be something that will, reward me a lot in the future if I, decide to take that path.

I'm looking for a job. Is there a way that you can help?
